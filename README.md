  <i>:zap: Accelerate your pull requests by awesome automations :zap:</i>
</p>

Hosted Danger helps agressive automations for your pull requests especially for assigning reviewers, checking CI statuses and merging.
Hosted Danger executes [danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) internally. In other words, it's a **Danger As A Service**. The differences of original danger are "when" and "what" to be executed.

- :heavy_check_mark: **When**: Hosted Danger is detached from CI processes. So danger can be executed interactively. (It's reacted for Github Webhooks.)
- :heavy_check_mark: **What**: It cannot refer the source codes and build products basically. It's specialized for Pull Requests automations, not for showing results of lints, tests or coverages.

:rocket: The Hosted Danger is activated on **more than 1500 repositoies** in Yahoo! JAPAN. :rocket:

<i>[danger/danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) is really awesome OSS. I would like to send a big respect for @orta.</i>
